Documenting your projects
=========================

Markdown
--------

Markdown is a way of formatting text so that it can be read and decorated by
automated systems. It's most common use in the ruby world is within README
documents.

There are many styles of markdown, but the one most commonly used is [Git
Flavoured Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
This is popular because READMEs using this markdown, are rendered nicely when
view via github. For this to work, the file should have an mb extension: README.md

The formatting allows the README authors to added headings, lists and links
that will be rendered into html with the appropriate tags. The result is a
document that is easier to read. Using a well formed README makes it easier to
get the message across as to how your application works.

Rdoc
-----

Rdoc is a ruby system for generating documentation. It has its [own flavour of
markdown](http://www.mikeperham.com/2010/12/16/using-rdoc/)
